**Learning:** Data-heavy dashboards often neglect navigation accessibility in favor of visual density.
**Action:** Always check sidebar navigation for `aria-current` and keyboard focus states, as these are critical for screen reader users to understand where they are.

**Action:** Always pair hover-based tooltips with a persistent, focusable trigger (like an info icon button) to ensure definitions are discoverable and accessible to all users.
